# Decisions

Notable choices and the reason for each, newest last, so the next session knows why.

## 2026-10-11: art direction, feel spec and working agreement
docs/art-direction.md, docs/feel.md and CLAUDE.md are the source of truth for art and feel
work. Features are frozen until the feel layer of existing units is done. The feel work runs
as six tickets, one vertical slice per PR, in this order: turn-to-face with accel/brake,
death animations with persistent wrecks, weapon VFX, recoil and turret lead, screen shake
and hit feedback, then the textured pipeline starting with the tank. Why: "make it modern"
gave no target to measure against; the docs are the ruler and screenshots the measurement.

## 2026-10-11: HUD redesign and onboarding parked
A HUD declutter and first-five-minutes pass (intro camera, quick battle, delayed AI offers)
were started and then stopped. Why: they are new features, and features are frozen until
the feel layer is done.

## 2026-10-11: ticket 1 may change unit movement
Destin approved turn-to-face and acceleration/braking in the movement trait, which is core
simulation. Pathing, the navmesh and avoidance settings stay untouched, and
"turn_to_face": false in data/movement.json restores the old movement. Why: the instant facing
snap and constant speed were the main cause of the sliding feel, and a visual-only fix can't
remove them. Known cost: a tank ordered behind itself turns in place first and arrives about
1.3 s later (tracked turn rate 150°/s).

## 2026-10-11: control and UX layer cleared despite the feature freeze
Destin asked for a second thread to bring the controls up to the StarCraft II standard
(docs/feel.md, "Control"), so it runs alongside the feel work instead of waiting for it. It
owns source/match/hud/ layout, input and camera handling; the art thread owns models,
shaders, VFX and the model fields in data/units/; the audio thread owns all sound, and the
onboarding thread owns translations, tooltips and the manual. Four PRs, one per area:
selection, orders, camera, feedback. Most of the list already existed (box select,
double-click, groups, attack-move, queued orders, rally points), so each PR only fills gaps.

## 2026-10-11: selection works like StarCraft II
A box over units and buildings takes only the units, so sweeping across the base grabs the
army; a box with only buildings still takes them. Ctrl + click selects all of a type on
screen, like a double-click. Shift + number adds to a group, and pressing a group's number
twice within 0.4 s centres the camera on it. The group bar sits top centre under the
diplomacy bar, because the bottom centre is taken by the unit card next to the minimap.
