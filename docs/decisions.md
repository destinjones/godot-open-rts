# Decisions

Notable choices and the reason for each, newest last, so the next session knows why.

## 2026-10-11: onboarding cleared despite the feature freeze
Destin asked for the onboarding and first-run thread (guided first match, first-time
hints, tooltips, first-run defaults, searchable manual) explicitly, so it goes ahead while
features are otherwise frozen. It stays out of models, shaders, VFX, audio and the control
layer.

## 2026-10-11: tutorials are data, run through the play harness
The tutorial steps moved from a constant in Guide.gd to data/tutorial/*.json: standard.json
keeps the old ten steps for every Guided match, first_match.json is the guided first match
on the main menu. A step waits for one of a fixed list of conditions (Guide.CONDITIONS) and
may run play-harness orders when it starts (give, spawn, declare_war, camera), so new
tutorials need no code. The same script is played end to end by
tools/harness/scenarios/tutorial-first-match.json. Why: Destin asked for data, not
hard-coded cutscenes, and reusing the harness keeps one order format. Known gap: a save
made mid-tutorial resumes with the standard steps, because carrying the script name would
change the save format, which needs asking first.
